This is an expansion addon for @Aki 's [True Tiles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815406414).

Prehistoric section:
-----------------
Shale: Tile, Insulated Tile, and Carpet Tile.  
Nickel & Iridium: Airflow Tile, Mesh and Metal Tiles.  
All textures are newly drawn, aiming to stay close to Aki’s original art style.  

Window Tile Section:
-----------------
Diamond: This material has a completely redrawn transparent texture for a more refined and high-end appearance.  
Resin & Sap: I've made a simple distinction between them, as their original game textures are almost the same.  
Glass: I believe the original style is already perfect, so no changes were made.  
I’d love to hear if anyone has better ideas!  

# How to Use
This is a texture expansion for True Tiles, so please subscribe to True Tiles first.  
Then, place this mod after True Tiles in your load order and restart the game manually.  
After restarting, you’ll see this texture pack listed in the True Tiles settings menu — make sure to check the texture pack option there to enable it.  
The message "No compatible module found" only appears the first time you subscribe and is just a display issue. It doesn’t affect functionality, so there’s no need to worry.  

P.S. I once thought about redrawing a full set of personal-style textures for every tile, but after seeing how many there are, I gave up halfway.  
Aki’s greatness needs no further explanation! 😆

(I'm torn between re-drawing the plastic Tile now, or waiting to gather more materials for the build)

~~Drawing the textures took thirty minutes. Making them seamless took a whole week. Life is unfair.~~
